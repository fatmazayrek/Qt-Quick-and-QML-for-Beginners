Hi everyone🚚

In this Project, I did same example 2 different ways🔀

In this example there are 5 different Rectangles and all of them can drag together👩‍🏫

First way, I created each Rectangle using Item 💓

Second way, I created all of them at once using Item ❇️

The important point of this Project:
 you should write drag.target: rootItem.parent  instead of drag.target: parent❗

I hope all is clear🎉
