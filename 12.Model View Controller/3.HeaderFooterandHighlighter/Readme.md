Hi everyone🤓

In this example I added header, footer and highlighter component in my ListView😌

With header, I defined my ListView’s header 🥸

With footer, you can add Component at the end of the ListView🥳

And with highlighter component, you can show currentItem which you clicked👹

I hope All will help your studies🦝
