Hello everyone🤓

In this example, I want to show the differences between NumberAnimation and PropertyAnimation. 
As their names, NumberAnimation defines the modifications of the number property, PropertyAnimations defines the modifications of properties of some Items. ✳️

When you click the beige rectangle, red rectangle move to right while changes the color from red to blue🟥🟦
