Hi everyone🌞

In this example, I showed you how can you change some properties of Components using transformOrigins🤓

When you click the Green Rectangle, x property changes. The rectangle moves right.▶️

If you click the Red Rectangle, it rotates🕟

If you click the Blue rectangle, it scales up from TopRight. Because its transformOrigin is set to Item.TopRight🔳

I hope it will help your studies🫠

I hope all make sense 😇
