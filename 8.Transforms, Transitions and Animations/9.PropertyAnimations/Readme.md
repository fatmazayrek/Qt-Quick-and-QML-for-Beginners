Hi everyone👽

In this title, I did simple PropertyAnimation  example. 🙃

You can change property of Component. And if you want to add Animation fort he changes, you must add PropertyAnimation. ✅

In this example, I change width of Rectangle and added animation for this change. When you click the Rectangle, width value decreases. ⬇️
