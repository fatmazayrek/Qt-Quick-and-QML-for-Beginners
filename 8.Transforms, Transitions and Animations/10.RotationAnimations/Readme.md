Hi everyone ☀️

I continue to explain about PropertyAnimation. There are severeal Animation object that inherit from PropertyAnimation. One of them is RotationAnimation.🛞

As its name, decribes the animation of rotation property. 🗯️

In this example, when you click the rectangle, it starts to rotate.You can control start and stop by click.✅
