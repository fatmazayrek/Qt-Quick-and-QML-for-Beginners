Hi everyone🌞

In this Project, I did a simple example about making own element in QML🎀

Firstly, I created a .qml file and wrote an Item containing a Rectangle and named as MButton🟢

This Item has properties and these properties are used as element properties like color, text or etc.⚒️

I hope it will be understandable for your projects❤️
