Hi everyone 💥

I continued to make Animations examples. ♾️

In animations, you can use different animations together. For this, you can use ParallelAnimation or SequentialAnimation. 
As their names, when you use the ParallelAnimation , animations run parallel. Or when you use the SequentialAnimation, animations run sequential. 🤓

In this example, There is a circle, when you click the window, the circle moves. When you use Sequential, the color of circle changes then circle moves right and then moves down. 
When you use ParallelAnimation, the circle moves while color is changing.🫠
