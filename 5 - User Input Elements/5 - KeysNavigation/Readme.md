Hi everyone😊

In this Project, I did a simple example about KeyNavigation❇️

Key-based user interfaces commonly allow the use of arrow keys to navigate between focusable items🌐

In this example, When you use keynavigation the focuses of the rectangles changes. If the focus of the rectangle changes, then the color of the rectangle changes🆗

For example, When the program first runs, Red rectangle is focus then when you use keyNavigation focus changes👌

I hope all is clear💓
