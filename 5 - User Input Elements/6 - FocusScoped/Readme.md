Hi everyone❤️‍🔥

In this example, I showed you how to use FocusScope🌐

When you create 2 same Item and want to give focus on each of them. You must use FocusScope🌄

In this example, first Buttons focus is true but then when you press the down key focus of the second Rectangle is true🆗

I hope all is clear🏨
