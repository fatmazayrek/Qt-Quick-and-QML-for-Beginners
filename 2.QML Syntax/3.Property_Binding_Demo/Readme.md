Hi everyone❤️

In this Project, I mentioned about Property Binding✅

In tihs Project, There are 2 Buttons Green and Yellow. All of these buttons change the size of Red Rectangle⬜

Firstly, height of the Red Rectangle depends on the its width. When you click the Yellow button, the width of the Red Rectangle is 1.6 times and also height changes depending on🌀

But when you click the Green button, height of the Red Rectangle is 2 times of the width anymore♻️

I hope it makes all clear🌞
