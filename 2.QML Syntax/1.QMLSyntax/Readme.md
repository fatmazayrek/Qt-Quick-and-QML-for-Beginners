Hi everyone🙋‍♀️

In this Project, I did a simple example about Parent-Child RelationShip♻️

There is a Row and there are 4 different Rectangle in this Row. When you Click these rectangles, a sentence about their color appears on the center of gray rectangle ⬜

Row has 4 Children and each child has own children like Text and MouseArea✅

I hope it makes all clear😊
