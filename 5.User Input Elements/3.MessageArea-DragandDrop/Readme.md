Hi everyone🌞

In this Project, I created 2 different MouseArea one at the bottom and one at the top🟢

If topMouseArea contains Mouse the color of the Blue Rectangle changes depending on whether it contains the Mouse🔺

Finally, BlueRectangle of the BottomMouseArea can be draggable. Also If you want, You can decide the border of the drag measure⏹️

I hope it is all clear❤️
