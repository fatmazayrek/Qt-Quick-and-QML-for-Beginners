Hi everyoneðŸŽ‰

In this example, I did a more than one Animation in the same ProjectðŸ’«

There are one Rectangle and Firstly, this rectangleâ€™s size become bigger then its color opacitiy decreases after this, itâ€™s size becomes smaller and 
its opacity increases then itâ€™s size become bigger so on.ðŸ§¶

I have could put all Animation together through SequentialAnimationðŸŽ
